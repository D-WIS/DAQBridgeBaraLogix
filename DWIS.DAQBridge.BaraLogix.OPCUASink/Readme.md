# Receiver (Sink) for Data Provided by the BaraLogix Bridge
This helper program acts as a sink that subscribes to data published on the D-WIS
Blackboard by the BaraLogix bridge. It queries the Blackboard using standard semantic
descriptions and verifies that the expected signals can be discovered and read.

Use this program to validate end-to-end publishing, confirm semantic metadata
resolution, and troubleshoot connectivity or mapping issues without involving other
consumers.
